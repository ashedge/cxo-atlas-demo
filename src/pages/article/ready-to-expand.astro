        <h2>Stage 7: Ready to Expand</h2>
        
        <p>You have the capital, the customers, and the product-market fit. Now it's time to scale your operations and grow your business systematically. This is where you build the infrastructure for long-term success.</p>

        <h3>What This Stage Looks Like</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You have funding to invest in growth</li>
          <li>You're hiring and building your team</li>
          <li>You're expanding into new markets or products</li>
          <li>You're building systems and processes</li>
          <li>You're scaling your operations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Team Building:</strong> Hiring the right people at the right time</li>
          <li><strong>Systems & Processes:</strong> Building scalable operations</li>
          <li><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Growing into new segments or geographies</li>
          <li><strong>Product Development:</strong> Expanding your product portfolio</li>
          <li><strong>Culture & Leadership:</strong> Maintaining company culture during growth</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
        <p>Scaling is about building systems that work without you. You need to transition from being the doer to being the leader, and from managing tasks to managing people and processes.</p>

        <h3>Critical Focus Areas</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Organizational structure and hierarchy</li>
          <li>Hiring and talent acquisition</li>
          <li>Operational systems and automation</li>
          <li>Market expansion strategy</li>
          <li>Financial management and reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scaling Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Horizontal Scaling:</strong> Expanding into new markets</li>
          <li><strong>Vertical Scaling:</strong> Adding new products/services</li>
          <li><strong>Operational Scaling:</strong> Improving efficiency and capacity</li>
          <li><strong>Team Scaling:</strong> Building and managing larger teams</li>
          <li><strong>Technology Scaling:</strong> Upgrading systems and infrastructure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>As you scale, you'll inevitably face operational challenges and complexity. When these become significant, you're entering the "Operational Issues" stage.</p>

        <div class="bg-pink-50 dark:bg-pink-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-pink-500">
          <h4>ðŸ“ˆ Pro Tip</h4>
          <p>Scale systematically, not chaotically. Focus on one area at a time - whether it's team, systems, or markets - and get it right before moving to the next.</p>
