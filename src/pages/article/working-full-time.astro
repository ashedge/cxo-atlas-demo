        <h2>Stage 3: Working Full-Time in Your Business</h2>
        
        <p>You've made the leap. This is your full-time job now. You're no longer dabbling - you're building a real business with your complete focus and energy.</p>

        <h3>What This Stage Looks Like</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Your business is your primary source of income</li>
          <li>You're working on the business 40+ hours per week</li>
          <li>You're making key operational decisions daily</li>
          <li>You're building systems and processes</li>
          <li>You're learning to manage cash flow and expenses</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cash Flow Management:</strong> Ensuring you have enough money to operate</li>
          <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Prioritizing the most important tasks</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Making critical business decisions under pressure</li>
          <li><strong>Product Development:</strong> Building and improving your offering</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Acquisition:</strong> Finding and converting customers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
        <p>This stage is about execution and momentum. You need to be productive, make good decisions quickly, and build sustainable systems. The pressure is real, but so is the opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Critical Focus Areas</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Revenue generation and customer acquisition</li>
          <li>Product/service development and improvement</li>
          <li>Financial management and cash flow</li>
          <li>Operational efficiency and systems</li>
          <li>Market positioning and competitive advantage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>When you have a working product or service ready for testing, you're entering the "Demo Product or Service" stage. This is where you start getting real feedback from potential customers.</p>

          <h4>âš¡ Pro Tip</h4>
          <p>Focus on one thing at a time. It's tempting to work on everything, but successful entrepreneurs prioritize ruthlessly and execute deeply on the most important tasks.</p>
