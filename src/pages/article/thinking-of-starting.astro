        <h2>Stage 1: Thinking of Starting a Business</h2>
        
        <p>You have an idea, maybe even a passion, but you're not sure if it's worth pursuing as a business. This is where every successful entrepreneur starts - with a spark of inspiration and a lot of questions.</p>

        <h3>What This Stage Looks Like</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You have a business idea but haven't committed to it yet</li>
          <li>You're researching and exploring the market</li>
          <li>You're talking to friends and family about your idea</li>
          <li>You're wondering if you have what it takes</li>
          <li>You're balancing your current job/life with this new possibility</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Idea Validation:</strong> Is this actually a good business idea?</li>
          <li><strong>Market Research:</strong> Who would buy this? How big is the market?</li>
          <li><strong>Personal Readiness:</strong> Am I cut out to be an entrepreneur?</li>
          <li><strong>Financial Planning:</strong> How much money do I need to start?</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> What am I giving up to pursue this?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
        <p>Most successful businesses don't start with a perfect idea. They start with someone willing to solve a problem and iterate based on real feedback. The key is moving from "thinking about it" to "testing it" as quickly as possible.</p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>If you're ready to move from thinking to doing, you're entering the "Committed to Starting" stage. This is where you make the decision to pursue your business idea seriously.</p>

          <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip</h4>
          <p>Don't wait for the perfect idea. Start with a problem you understand and can solve. You can always pivot later based on what you learn from real customers.</p>
