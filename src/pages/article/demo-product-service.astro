        <h2>Stage 4: Demo Product or Service</h2>
        
        <p>You've built something. It might not be perfect, but it's real and it works. This is your first version - your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - and it's time to get it in front of real people.</p>

        <h3>What This Stage Looks Like</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You have a working product or service to show</li>
          <li>You're actively seeking customer feedback</li>
          <li>You're testing your value proposition</li>
          <li>You're learning what customers actually want</li>
          <li>You're iterating based on real feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Customer Acquisition:</strong> Finding people willing to test your product</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback Collection:</strong> Getting honest, actionable feedback</li>
          <li><strong>Product Iteration:</strong> Deciding what to change and what to keep</li>
          <li><strong>Quality vs. Speed:</strong> Balancing perfection with learning</li>
          <li><strong>Market Validation:</strong> Proving there's real demand</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
        <p>This stage is about learning, not perfection. Your goal is to validate your assumptions and understand what customers actually value. Be prepared to pivot based on what you learn.</p>

        <h3>Critical Activities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer interviews and feedback sessions</li>
          <li>Product testing and usability studies</li>
          <li>Market validation and demand testing</li>
          <li>Iteration planning and prioritization</li>
          <li>Early customer relationship building</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Success Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Customer engagement and usage</li>
          <li>Feedback quality and actionability</li>
          <li>Market interest and demand signals</li>
          <li>Product-market fit indicators</li>
          <li>Customer retention and satisfaction</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>When you start getting paying customers, you're entering the "Has Some Customers" stage. This is where you transition from testing to real business.</p>

          <h4>ðŸŽ¯ Pro Tip</h4>
          <p>Focus on learning, not selling. Your goal is to understand your customers deeply, not to make money yet. The insights you gain here will determine your long-term success.</p>
